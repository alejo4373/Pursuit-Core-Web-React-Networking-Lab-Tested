/*
Should the button to generate a deck fetch a new deck and take <Menu/> away and display <Game/>? 
I think that when generating a new deck the "Existing deck id" field should fill up, instead of having to display the deck id in a separate <p>
Not clear that <Game/> should not show when no state. Found out in when ran npm test
For some reason I thought cypress would compile and run the app for me, but I guess not. I have to have it running on another terminal.
The "creating new deck" test intercepts https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/draw?count=2. Which creates a new deck at the same time it draws two cards. Fellows  might (and I did) implement this in two separate requests one to generate the deck and one to draw 2 cards then the call cypress expects is never intercepted.
